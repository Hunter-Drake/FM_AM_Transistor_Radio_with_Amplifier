## Project Overview

I intend to design, build, and test an AM/FM tranistor radio. This project includes several different components. There is an FM radio receiver, which would capture and demodulate a commerical FM signal. There is an AM radio receiver, which would capture and demodulate a commercial AM signal. Each of these receivers would require a tuning circuit as well. The output to the receivers would go into a switching circuit to decide between AM and FM. The switching circuit would then go into an audio amplifier, which would allow a speaker or headphones to be hooked up to it.

## Educational Value Added

I would like to gain three things from this project. First and foremost, I plan to improve my analog design skills. I plan to do this by designing the receivers, the switching circuit, the tuning circuits, and the amplifier which are all analog designs. Secondly, I want some experience with RF. RF engineering often accompanies analog design, therefore it is a useful skill to have. My knowledge in this area will come from the RF theory I will have to understand in order to design the receivers. It will also be useful to be able to design circuits that run at RF frequencies. Lastly, I want to learn how to do PCB design. Like RF engineering, this is a skill that often accompanies analog design, so it will be useful to know. I plan to learn this skill by putting the circuits on PCBs.
